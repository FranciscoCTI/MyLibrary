<Strong> "MyLibrary" Application</Strong>

Hello, this application was created with the aim to improve and show my skills in different programming technologies.  
The application manages house libraries of phisical books, where the users can create, remove and edit book instances.
In the future, the idea is changing the UI to web technologies so i can upload it online, and create a real service where people can manage their phisical libraries, share books between users, upload books opinions and overall create a community around phisical books.
